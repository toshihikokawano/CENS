<h1> Usage </h1>
<h2><a name="compile"> To Compile CENS </a></h2>

<p>You need a standard C++ compiler, such as gcc.  CENS comes with a
generic <code>Makefile</code>. At least c++ in Xcode or gcc in
MacPorts on MacOS should work to compile CENS. Any extra libraries are
not required.</p>

<p>To compile CENS, go into the source directory, edit
<code>Makefile</code> as needed, then just "make" should work. The code
does not need to install anywhere, since this is a stand-alone
executable.</p>


<h2><a name="ensdf"> ENSDF </a></h2>

<p>CENS reads a single ENSDF file, which contains the <code>ADOPTED
LEVELS, GAMMA</code> segment as below. This file must be for a unique
Z and A.  Unfortunately the current version of CENS does not look for
a proper part in a big file when many Z,A sections are
concatenated.</p>

<pre id="dat">

 56FE2 L XREF=J$                                                                
</pre>

<p>A recommended file name is in the form of <code>ENSDF0ZZAAA.dat</code>,
but not necessary. CENS assumes this type of names when an ENSDF file name
is not explicitly given.</p>


<h2><a name="option"> Command Line Options </a></h2>

<p>CENS runs in a command line mode. The syntax is
<pre id="syn">
   % cens -p <i>option</i>  <i>ENSDFfile</i>
   % cens -p <i>option</i>  -z <i>Znumber</i> -a <i>Anumber</i>
</pre>

<p>The first syntax is to provide an ENSDF data file name as a
command-line option.  The second example is to provide both Z and A
numbers. Z-number can be a chemical symbol like 'Al' too.  In this
case, CENS assumes the ENSDF file name
is <code>ENSDF0ZZAAA.dat</code>.


<p>When the variable <code>ENSDFDirectory</code> is set
in <code>config.dat</code>, CENS looks for the ENSDF data in that
directory. Otherwise the current directory is the default
location. Instead of setting
<code>ENSDFDirectory</code>, you can provide the full-path of the 
ENSDF file, like <code>/your/ensdf/directory/ENSDF025055.dat</code>.

<p>The command line <code>-p</code> option controls the output.
When not given (or option is zero), CENS produces a RIPL-like file.</p>

<p>When <i>option</i> = 1, raw data of the discrete level energy,
spin, parity, and gamma decay given in ENSDF are printed in XML. The
case 2 prints the same data but minimum data fixes (energy adjustment
and branching ration normalization) are performed.</p>

<p> The option 3 and 4 are for printing the level density and the spin
distribution as a result of statistical analyis. The option 3 prints
the level density parameter and spin cut-off parameter. The option 4
produces X-Y column data for plotting. See below.</p>


<h2><a name="gnuplot"> Data Plotting Output </a></h2>

<p>The option <code> -p 4 </code> produces numerical data of
both the level density and spin distribution. These tables 
can be visualized by plotting tools, such as gnuplot.</p>

<pre id="dat">
#    39   99
# Cumulative Number of Levels
 0.00000e+00 1.00000e+00
 1.25122e-01 2.00000e+00
 2.83730e-01 3.00000e+00
 4.82210e-01 4.00000e+00
...
 3.02801e+00 4.00000e+01
 3.17891e+00 4.10000e+01


# Constant Temperature Model
 1.00000e-01 4.22094e-01
 2.00000e-01 9.30731e-01
 3.00000e-01 1.54365e+00
...
</pre>

<p>The output sequence is as follows.</p>

<p>1: Discrete level energy, and number given in ENSDF. </p>

<p>2: Cumulative level density calculated with the constant temperature model. </p>

<p>3: The highest level up to which discrete level information (energy, spin, and parity)
are considered to be complete.</p>

<p>4: The highest level up to which there is no missing levels.</p>

<p>5: Distribution of spin given in ENSDF. </p>

<p>6: Spin distribution calculated with the derived spin cut-off parameter.</p>
