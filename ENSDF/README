Because CENS only processes the adopted level sections in an ENSDF
file, the origial ENSDF that include different Z-number in the same
A-chain should be separated into each (Z,A) set. This directory
contains utilities to pre-process the entire ENSDF files.

1: download all the ENSDF database under the orig directory

Their name might be ensdf.AAA, where AAA is the mass number from 001
to 300.  If not, change the run.sh script accordingly.

2: run "run.sh" script

This create a lot of files under the adopted directory, with the file
names of ENSDFZZZAAA.dat. ZZZ and AAA are the charge and mass numbers.
These files include the adopted level section only, which can be
processed by CENS.
